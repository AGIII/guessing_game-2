<h2> The Script</h2>
<p> The script is asking for the name of the user and is storing the input in a variable we call 'name'.  The script then uses an alert to greet to user.  Once this is complete. The game begins. The 'score' variable is set to 0, and variables are declared for wether each question is right or wrong (these are stored as a boolean as each question is answered. 'if/else' statements are used to check each answer and the correct response is returned as an alert. At the end of the questions, the score value is displayed to the user through an alert. If the values of the 'answer' variables are 'false' the user is reminded of the correct answers.</p>
